# Test scripts

Usage : run these scripts from batkube's root directory.

These scripts were written for conveniency, they do not provide a robust testing environment.

To run a full test : 
1 - `cd` into Batkube root directory
2 - `./scripts/batkube.sh` and `./scripts/kube-scheduler.sh /path/to/scheduler/binary` in any order
3 - `./scripts/batsim.sh` to start the simulation
